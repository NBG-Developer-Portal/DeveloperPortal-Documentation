        ## Functionality at a glance

        NBG "Payment Initiation" API follows the [UK Open Banking Specification
        v3.1.](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1)


        ### Perform a Payment

        * Create a consent in order to perform a payment

        * Confirm availability of funds

        * Create a Payment (Domestic / International, Immediate Payment / Scheduled Payment / Standing Order)

        * Get Consent Status

        * Get Payment Status



        ## Quick Getting Started

        1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB

        2. Go to **"APPS"**
        3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\"** and follow the steps below:
            1. Enter the title of your Organization
            2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)
            3. Click **"SUBMIT"**
        4. Select the Organization of choice and click **"ADD AN APPLICATION"** 
              1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)
              2. Check **\"Authorization Code\" and \"Client Credentials\"** 
              3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)

                  You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*
              4. Click **"SUBMIT"**
              5. Store the APPs **"Client ID"** and **"Client Secret"**
        
        
        5. Go to **"API PRODUCTS"** and select the **PAYMENT INITIATION - UK OPEN BANKING**

        4. Click **\"START USING THIS API\"**, choose your app and click
    **"SUBSCRIBE"**

        5. Get an Access Token using the credentials you signed in as a developer

        6. Create a Sandbox

        7. Play with the API 



        ## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)

        This API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a
        Bearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be retrieved using the client_id and
        client_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API, and your own credentials
        (username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB. The scopes are defined below:


        **Sandbox Scopes:** openid profile **sandbox-uk-payments-api-v1**


        **Production Scopes:** openid profile **payments**


        **Authorization Endpoint:** https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize


        **Token Endpoint:** https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token


        See more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)



        ## Create your Sandbox

        Create a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox
        with a unique sandbox-id.


        __Important!__ Before proceeding save the sandbox id you just created.


        When you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.


        Each sandbox created through NBG Account sandbox API is compatible with other NBG Open Bank sandbox
        APIs.


        ## Start Testing

        Once you have your sandbox-id, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the
        mandatory http header **sandbox-id**  and the http headers described below.


        ## Important notes


        **Request headers**


        The following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:


        1. Authorization. The Auth2 Token

        2. x-fapi-financial-id. The unique id of the ASPSP to which the request is issued (Default: NBG)

        3. x-idempotency-key. The Idempotency Key for the request

        4. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID



        **Consent**


        In order to be able to effectively start using the Endpoints the appropriate Consent needs to be
        created and set to the 'Authorised' status. 


        ## Error Codes

        The error codes and their description can be found
        [here](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1#Read/WriteDataAPISpecification-v3.1-ErrorResponseStructure)


        # Implementation Specifics 

        Below you may find more specific information & limitations regarding the implementation followed in
        the Production API.

        ## Token Endpoint Client Authentication

        At this point the supported __Client Authentication__ method is "__Client Secret Basic__" - usage of
        "Client ID" & "Client Secret".

        ## Consent Authorization

        In order for a PSU to Authorize a Consent, they need to be redirected to the appropriate Consent UI.
        <br /><br />  In order for this redirection to take place the TPP needs to follow the Authorization
        Endpoint by ammending the generated "Consent ID", like this:
        https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?consent_id={{consent_id}}

        <br/><br/>

        Once the PSU is redirected to the Consent Authorization Screen, they need to enter their IBank
        Credentials and either Authorize or Reject the Consent. 

        <br/><br/> 

        At this point the Consent is binded with the PSU.


        ## Message Signing

        This implementation ignore's the "b64" JWS JOSE Header value, but the Signature must be created using
        the Base64 Encoded Payload method. 

        <br /><br /> 

        Currently, only the __PS256__ Signing Algorithm is supported.


        ## Local Instrument 

        Even though the property is accepted and documented in the Consent / Payment Information, it is not
        used in the Payment Operation.


        ## Debtor Account

        The following Scheme Names are supported: 

        1. UK.OBIE.IBAN

        2. UK.OBIE.BBAN

        3. GR.NBG.ACCOUNT - Represents the NBG Account Number


        ## Creditor Account

        ### Domestic Pyaments

        The following Scheme Names are supported: 

        1. UK.OBIE.IBAN


        ### International Pyaments

        The following Scheme Names are supported: 

        1. UK.OBIE.IBAN

        2. UK.OBIE.BBAN

        3. GR.NBG.ACCOUNT - Represents the Creditor's Account Number


        When these "__UK.OBIE.BBAN__" and "__GR.NBG.ACCOUNT__" Enumerations are used, the Creditor's BIC
        Identification is required (_OBExternalFinancialInstitutionIdentification4Code_)


        ## File Payments

        The "__CustomerCreditTransferInitiationV03 pain.001.001.03__" File Type is supported. <br/> You may
        find a description of the supported XML file
        [here](https://files.nbg.gr/uk-obp/SEPA_XML_Μαζικές%20Πιστώσεις%20v1.0.pdf)

                        Usage: the  instruction identification is a point to point reference that can be used
                        between the instructing party and the instructed party to refer to the individual
                        instruction. It can be included in several messages related to the instruction.

                        Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for reconciliation or to link tasks
                        relating to the transaction. It can be included in several messages related to the
                        transaction.
