    ## Functionality at a glance

    The NBG "UK OPB - Payment Initiation v3.1.0" API follows the [UK Open Banking Specification
    v3.1.](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1)

    This Payment Initiation API Specification describes the flows and payloads for initiating a general
    payment-order. 

    The API endpoints described here allow a PISP to:  

    1. Register an intent to stage a payment-order consent. 

    2. Optionally confirm available funds for a payment-order (domestic and international immediate
    payments only). 

    3. Subsequently submit the payment-order for processing. 

    4. Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order consent or payment-order resource.

    
    ## Quick Getting Started


    1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB

    2. Go to **"APPS"**
    
    3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\"** and follow the steps below:
        1. Enter the title of your Organization
        2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)
        3. Click **"SUBMIT"**

    4. Select the Organization of choice and click **"ADD AN APPLICATION"** 
          1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)
          2. Check **\"Authorization Code\" and \"Client Credentials\"** 
          3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)
              
              You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*
          4. Click **"SUBMIT"**
          5. Store the APPs **"Client ID"** and **"Client Secret"**
    5. Go to **"API PRODUCTS"** and select the **PAYMENT INITIATION - UK OPEN BANKING API**
    
    6. Click **\"START USING THIS API\"**, choose your app and click
    **"SUBSCRIBE"**

    7. Get an Access Token using the Access Token Flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below

    8. Create a Sandbox

    9. Play with the API


    ### Sandbox Flow

    The Sandbox Flow matches the Production Flow. The difference lies into the Data used. Instead of live
    data, the Sandbox flow uses mocked data.


    ### Production Flow  

    The Production Flow is described in the [UK Open Banking v3.1.0
    Specification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937754701/Payment+Initiation+API+Specification+-+v3.1)

    More details about the implementation specifics followed, please visit section **UK OPB Implementation
    Specifics**


    ## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)

    The UK Open Banking v3.1.0 Specification uses the **OAuth2** protocol for authentication and
    authorization, which means that a Bearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be
    retrieved using the client_id and client_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this
    API, and finally your own credentials (username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology
    HUB. 


    The scopes are defined below:


    **Sandbox Scopes:** 

             sandbox-uk-payments-api-v1


    **Production Scopes:** 

            payments


    **Authorization Endpoint:** 

            https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize


    **Token Endpoint:** 

            https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token


    See more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)



    ## QSEAL Certificates

    This section provides an overview of the message signing process that TPPs should implement to consume
    the NBG UK Open Banking Payment Initiation API.


    You can download the NBG certificates to validate the API responses using the following links:

    - [Sandbox Certificate](https://files.nbg.gr/certificates/NBG%20QSeal%20Sandbox.cer)  

    - [Production Certificate](https://files.nbg.gr/certificates/NBG%20QSeal%20production.cer)


    **Signing flow**



    QSeal Certificates provide a solution for non-repudiation that does not rely on TLS.  NBG UK Open
    Banking Payment Initiation API employs a JWS (JSON Web Signature) with detached content (as defined in
    [UK OPB v3.1.0 Specification - Message
    Signing](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1#Read/WriteDataAPISpecification-v3.1-MessageSigning.1))
    in the HTTP header \"x-jws-signature\". 

    A TPP's private key should be used to sign the requests, while the NBG's private key is used to sign
    the response. Signers must sign the message using the PS256 algorithm.


    **JWS Construction**


    The TPP must construct the JWS using a private key with a corresponding QSeal certificate. For more
    information on how to construct the JWS Signature please visit [UK OPB v3.1.0 Specification - Message
    Signing](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1#Read/WriteDataAPISpecification-v3.1-MessageSigning.1))


    ## SMS Challenge (One Time Password)

    In order to successfully complete a Payment you will need to provide the SMS OTP (One Time Password)
    in the corresponding Payments Consent UI Screen.


    By default the SMS OTP will be sent to the mobile number declared upon singing up in the NBG
    Technology HUB. 


    ## Create your Sandbox

    Create a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox
    with a unique sandbox-id.

    When you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.

    **_Important!_** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all the API calls. Sandbox
    endpoints are not included in the production version API.


    ## Start Testing

    Once you have your sandbox-id, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the
    mandatory http header **sandbox-id**  and the http headers described below.


    ## Important notes


    **Request headers**


    The following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:


    1. Authorization. The Auth2 Token

    2. x-fapi-financial-id. The unique id of the ASPSP to which the request is issued (Default: NBG)

    3. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID


    **Consent**


    In order to be able to effectively start using the Endpoints the appropriate Consent needs to be
    created and set to the 'Authorised' status. 


    ## Error Codes

    The error codes and their description can be found
    [here](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1#Read/WriteDataAPISpecification-v3.1-ErrorResponseStructure)


    # UK OPB Implementation Specifics 

    Below you may find more specific information & limitations regarding the implementation followed in
    the Production API.

    ## Token Endpoint Client Authentication

    At this point the supported __Client Authentication__ method is "__Client Secret Basic__" - usage of
    "Client ID" & "Client Secret".

    ## Consent Authorization

    In order for a PSU to Authorize a Consent, they need to be redirected to the appropriate Consent UI.
    <br /><br />  In order for this redirection to take place the TPP needs to follow the Authorization
    Endpoint by ammending the generated "Consent ID", like this:
    https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?consent_id={{consent_id}}

    <br/><br/>

    Once the PSU is redirected to the Consent Authorization Screen, they need to enter their IBank
    Credentials and either Authorize or Reject the Consent. 

    <br/><br/> 

    At this point the Consent is binded with the PSU.


    ## Message Signing

    This implementation ignores the "b64" JWS JOSE Header value, but the Signature must be created using
    the Base64 Encoded Payload method. 

    <br /><br /> 

    Currently, only the __PS256__ Signing Algorithm is supported.


    ## Local Instrument 

    Even though the property is accepted and documented in the Consent / Payment Information, it is not
    used in the Payment Operation.


    ## Debtor Account

    The following Scheme Names are supported: 

    1. UK.OBIE.IBAN

    2. GR.NBG.ACCOUNT - Represents the NBG Account Number


    ## Creditor Account

    ### Domestic Payments

    The following Scheme Names are supported: 

    1. UK.OBIE.IBAN


    ### International Payments

    The following Scheme Names are supported: 

    1. UK.OBIE.IBAN

    2. GR.NBG.ACCOUNT - Represents the Creditor's Account Number

    When the "__GR.NBG.ACCOUNT__" Enumeration is used, the Creditor's BIC
    Identification is required (_OBExternalFinancialInstitutionIdentification4Code_)


    ## File Payments

    The "__CustomerCreditTransferInitiationV03 pain.001.001.03__" File Type is supported. <br/> You may
    find a description of the supported XML file
    [here](https://files.nbg.gr/uk-obp/SEPA_XML_Μαζικές%20Πιστώσεις%20v1.0.pdf)
