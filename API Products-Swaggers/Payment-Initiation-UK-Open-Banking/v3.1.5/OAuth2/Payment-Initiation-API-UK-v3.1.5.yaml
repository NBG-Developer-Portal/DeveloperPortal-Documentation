  title: Payment Initiation API Specification - UK
  description: "## Functionality at a glance\r\n\r\nThe NBG \"UK OPB - Payment Initiation v3.1.5\" API follows the [UK Open Banking Specification\r\nv3.1.5](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/payment-initiation-api-profile.html)\r\n\r\nThis Payment Initiation API Specification describes the flows and payloads for initiating a general\r\npayment-order. \r\n\r\nThe API endpoints described here allow a PISP to:  \r\n\r\n1. Register an intent to stage a payment-order consent. \r\n\r\n2. Optionally confirm available funds for a payment-order (domestic and international immediate\r\npayments only). \r\n\r\n3. Subsequently submit the payment-order for processing. \r\n\r\n4. Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order consent or payment-order resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Getting Started\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB\r\n\r\n2. Go to **\"APPS\"**\r\n\r\n3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\\\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\\\"** and follow the steps below:\r\n\t1. Enter the title of your Organization\r\n\t2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)\r\n\t3. Click **\"SUBMIT\"**\r\n\r\n4. Select the Organization of choice and click **\"ADD AN APPLICATION\"** \r\n\t  1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)\r\n\t  2. Check **\\\"Authorization Code\\\" and \\\"Client Credentials\\\"** \r\n\t  3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)\r\n\t\t  \r\n\t\t  You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*\r\n\t  4. Click **\"SUBMIT\"**\r\n\t  5. Store the APPs **\"Client ID\"** and **\"Client Secret\"**\r\n5. Go to **\"API PRODUCTS\"** and select the **PAYMENT INITIATION - UK OPEN BANKING API**\r\n\r\n6. Click **\\\"START USING THIS API\\\"**, choose your app and click\r\n**\"SUBSCRIBE\"**\r\n\r\n7. Get an Access Token using the Access Token Flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below\r\n\r\n8. Create a Sandbox\r\n\r\n9. Play with the API\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sandbox Flow\r\n\r\nThe Sandbox Flow matches the Production Flow. The difference lies into the Data used. Instead of live\r\ndata, the Sandbox flow uses mocked data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Production Flow  \r\n\r\nThe Production Flow is described in the [UK Open Banking v3.1.5\r\nSpecification](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/payment-initiation-api-profile.html)\r\n\r\nMore details about the implementation specifics followed, please visit section **UK OPB Implementation\r\nSpecifics**\r\n\r\n\r\n## VOP Feature Integration\r\n\r\n As part of the integration of VOP (Verification of Payee) functionality in the NBG UK Open Banking Payment Initiation API, two additional endpoints have been introduced to expose the results of VOP verifications.\r\n\r\nNew Endpoints Added:\r\n\r\n - **Individual Payment Verifications:** Following individual payment initiation, VOP results can be retrieved via the dedicated endpoint GET /payee-verifications/{consentId}.\r\n\r\n - **Bulk Verifications:** For bulk payments, VOP results for all payees within the file can be accessed through GET /bulk-payee-verifications/{consentId}.\r\n\r\n## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)\r\n\r\nThe UK Open Banking v3.1.5 Specification uses the **OAuth2** protocol for authentication and\r\nauthorization, which means that a Bearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be\r\nretrieved using the client_id and client_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this\r\nAPI, and finally your own credentials (username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology\r\nHUB. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe scopes are defined below:\r\n\r\n**Authorization Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t\thttps://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize\r\n\r\n\r\n**Token Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t\thttps://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authorization Code ###\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t\t sandbox-uk-payments-api-v1 offline_access\r\n\r\n\r\n**Production Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t\tpayments offline_access\r\n\r\n\r\n### Client Credentials ###\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t\t sandbox-uk-payments-api-v1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Production Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t\tpayments\r\n\r\nSee more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)\r\n\r\n## QWAC Certificates\r\n\r\nTPPs are required to present a QWAC certificate during API consumption. The API checks that this certificate has been provided and is valid. In sandbox mode the certificate validations are optional. To validate your certificate in sandbox implementation, please send us your QWAC certificate at developer@nbg.gr and set the HTTP Header **\\\"x-sandbox-qwac-certificate-check\\\"** with the value **\\\"true\\\"** in your requests. \r\n\r\n## QSEAL Certificates\r\n\r\nThis section provides an overview of the message signing process that TPPs should implement to consume\r\nthe NBG UK Open Banking Payment Initiation API.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can download the NBG certificates to validate the API responses using the following links:\r\n\r\n- [NBG QSeal Certificate](https://files.nbg.gr/certificates/NBG%20QSeal%20production.cer)\r\n\r\n**Signing flow**\r\n\r\nQSeal Certificates provide a solution for non-repudiation that does not rely on TLS.  NBG UK Open\r\nBanking Payment Initiation API employs a JWS (JSON Web Signature) with detached content (as defined in\r\n[UK OPB v3.1.5 Specification - Message\r\nSigning](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/read-write-data-api-profile.html#message-signing-2))\r\nin the HTTP header \\\"x-jws-signature\\\". \r\n\r\nA TPP's private key should be used to sign the requests, while the NBG's private key is used to sign\r\nthe response. Signers must sign the message using the PS256 algorithm.\r\n\r\n**JWS Construction**\r\n\r\nThe TPP must construct the JWS using a private key with a corresponding QSeal certificate. For more\r\ninformation on how to construct the JWS Signature please visit [UK OPB v3.1.5 Specification - Message\r\nSigning](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/read-write-data-api-profile.html#message-signing-2))\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Signature Validation**\r\n\r\nAlthough request signature validations are performed by-default in production, in sandbox implementation they are optional.\r\n\r\nTo validate your signature in sandbox mode, please send us your QSEAL certificate at developer@nbg.gr and set the HTTP Header **\\\"x-sandbox-signature-check\\\"** with the value **\\\"true\\\"** in your requests. \r\n\r\n## SMS Challenge (One Time Password)\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully complete a Payment you will need to provide the SMS OTP (One Time Password)\r\nin the corresponding Payments Consent UI Screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default the SMS OTP will be sent to the mobile number declared upon singing up in the NBG\r\nTechnology HUB. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Create your Sandbox\r\n\r\nCreate a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox\r\nwith a unique sandbox-id.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.\r\n\r\n**_Important!_** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all the API calls. Sandbox\r\nendpoints are not included in the production version API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Start Testing\r\n\r\nOnce you have your sandbox-id, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the\r\nmandatory http header **sandbox-id**  and the http headers described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important notes\r\n\r\n\r\n**Request headers**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Authorization. The Auth2 Token\r\n\r\n2. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID\r\n\r\n\r\n**Consent**\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to effectively start using the Endpoints the appropriate Consent needs to be\r\ncreated and set to the 'Authorised' status. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Error Codes\r\n\r\nThe error codes and their description can be found\r\n[here](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.5/profiles/read-write-data-api-profile.html#error-response-structure)\r\n\r\n\r\n# UK OPB Implementation Specifics \r\n\r\nBelow you may find more specific information & limitations regarding the implementation followed in\r\nthe Production API.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Token Endpoint Client Authentication\r\n\r\nAt this point the supported __Client Authentication__ method is \"__Client Secret Basic__\" - usage of\r\n\"Client ID\" & \"Client Secret\".\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Consent Authorization\r\n\r\nFor a PSU to Authorize a Consent, they need to be redirected to the appropriate Consent UI.\r\n\r\nFor this redirection to take place the TPP needs to follow the Authorization Endpoint by amending the generated \"Consent ID\", like this: https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?consent_id={{consent_id}}&client_id={{client_id}}&scope={{scope}}&redirect_uri={{redirect_uri}}&response_type=code\r\n\r\nOnce the PSU is redirected to the Consent Authorization Screen, they need to enter their IBank (Production) or Developer Portal (Sandbox) Credentials and either Authorize or Reject the Consent.\r\n\r\nAt this point the Consent is binded with the PSU.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Message Signing\r\n\r\nThis implementation ignores the \"b64\" JWS JOSE Header value, but the Signature must be created using\r\nthe Base64 Encoded Payload method. \r\n\r\nCurrently, only the __PS256__ Signing Algorithm is supported.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Local Instrument \r\n\r\nEven though the property is accepted and documented in the Consent / Payment Information, it is not\r\nused in the Payment Operation in any way.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Debtor Account\r\n\r\nThe following Scheme Names are supported: \r\n\r\n1. UK.OBIE.IBAN\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Creditor Account\r\n\r\n### Domestic Payments\r\n\r\nFor Domestic Payments the following Scheme Names are supported: \r\n\r\n1. UK.OBIE.IBAN\r\n\r\n\r\n### International Payments\r\n\r\nFor International Payments the following Scheme Names are supported: \r\n\r\n1. UK.OBIE.IBAN\r\n\r\n2. GR.NBG.ACCOUNT : Custom Scheme. Represents the Creditor's Account Number\r\n\r\n!! When the \"__GR.NBG.ACCOUNT__\" Enumeration is used, the Creditor's BIC\r\nIdentification is required (_OBExternalFinancialInstitutionIdentification4Code_)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## File Payments\r\n\r\nThe \"__CustomerCreditTransferInitiationV03 pain.001.001.03__\" File Type is supported. <br/> You may\r\nfind a description of the supported XML file\r\n[here](https://files.nbg.gr/uk-obp/SEPA_XML_Μαζικές%20Πιστώσεις%20v1.0.pdf)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Charges\r\n\r\n- Charge Type “**BorneByCreditor**” is allowed only to the following Currencies : \"USD\", \"CAD\", \"ZAR\", \"JPY\", \"AUD\", \"HKD\", \"TRY\"\r\n- Chage Type \"**BorneByDebtor**\" is allowed only for the \"EUR\" Currency\r\n- Charge Type \"**BorneByDebtor**\" is not allowed for transfers to the following countries : \"GR\",\"AT\",\"BE\",\"BG\",\"CY\",\"CZ\",\"DE\",\"DK\",\"EE\",\"ES\",\"FI\",\"FR\",\"GB\",\"GF\",\"GI\",\"GP\",\"HU\",\"IE\",\"IS\",\"IT\",\"LI\",\"LT\",\"LU\",\"LV\",\"MC\",\"MQ\",\"MT\",\"NL\",\"NO\",\"RE\",\"RO\",\"PL\",\"PT\",\"SE\",\"SK\",\"SI\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Greek Characters\r\nGreek characters are allowed in the Unstructured field of the RemittanceInformation object only for domestic payments with EURO currency\r\n\r\nOther allowed characters: \r\n\r\n1. All lowercase and uppercase Latin letters\r\n2. Numbers\r\n3. Space\r\n4. The characters - ? : ( ) . , ‘ + (hyphen, question mark, colon, parentheses, period, comma, apostrophe, plus)\r\n\r\n\r\n If there are any other characters (eg _ %) the transfer will not get executed and an error ___RemittanceInformation Unstructured field contains invalid characters___ will be returned.<br/>\r\n\r\n# Feedback and Questions\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback and answer your questions.
