  title: Confirmation of Funds API Specification - UK
  description: "## Functionality at a glance\r\n\r\n\r\nThis specification describes the Confirmation of Funds API flows and payloads.\r\n\r\nThe API endpoints described here allow a Card Based Payment Instrument Issuer ('CBPII') to: \r\n\r\nRegister an intent to confirm funds by creating a \"funds confirmation consent\" resource with an ASPSP,\r\nfor agreement between the PSU and ASPSP. This consent is a long lived consent, and contains the length\r\nof time (expiration date) the customer (PSU) would like to provide to the CBPII; and  Subsequently\r\nmake a request to confirm funds are available. Funds can only be confirmed against the currency of the\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB\r\n\r\n2. Go to **\"APPS\"** and  click **\\\"Create New App\\\"**:\r\n\t1. Fill in the form fields. \r\n\t2. Check **\\\"Authorization Code\\\" and \\\"Client Credentials\\\"** \r\n\t3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively). You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*\r\n\t4. **Submit** your new APP\r\n\t5. Store the APPs **\"Client ID\"** and **\"Client Secret\"**\r\n\r\n3. Go to **\"API PRODUCTS\"** and select the **Confirmation Of Funds - UK OPEN BANKING**\r\n\r\n4. Click **\\\"START USING THIS API\\\"**, choose your app and click **\"SUBSCRIBE\"**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sandbox Flow\r\n\r\nThe Sandbox Flow matches the Production Flow. The difference lies into the Data used. Instead of live\r\ndata, the Sandbox flow uses mocked data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Production Flow  \r\n\r\nThe Production Flow is described in the [UK Open Banking v3.1.0\r\nSpecification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937951380/Confirmation+of+Funds+API+Specification+-+v3.1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)\r\n\r\nThis API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a\r\nBearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be retrieved using the client_id and\r\nclient_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API, and your own credentials\r\n(username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB. The scopes are defined below:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t\tsandbox-uk-fundsconfirmations-api-v1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Production Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t\tfundsconfirmations\r\n\r\n\r\n**Authorization Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t\thttps://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize\r\n\r\n\r\n**Token Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t\thttps://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token\r\n\r\n\r\nSee more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Create your Sandbox\r\n\r\nCreate a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox\r\nwith a unique sandbox-id.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.\r\n\r\n\r\n**_Important!_** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all the API calls. Sandbox\r\nendpoints are not included in the production version API.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Start Testing\r\n\r\nOnce you have your sandbox-id, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the\r\nmandatory http header **sandbox-id**  and the http headers described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important notes\r\n\r\n\r\n**Request headers**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Authorization. The Auth2 Token\r\n\r\n2. x-fapi-financial-id. The unique id of the ASPSP to which the request is issued (Default: NBG)\r\n\r\n3. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID\r\n\r\n\r\n**Consent**\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to effectively start using the Endpoints the appropriate Consent needs to be\r\ncreated and set to the 'Authorised' status. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Error Codes\r\n\r\nThe error codes and their description can be found\r\n[here](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1#Read/WriteDataAPISpecification-v3.1-ErrorResponseStructure)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Implementation Specifics \r\n\r\nBelow you may find more specific information & limitations regarding the implementation followed in\r\nthe Production API.\r\n\r\n## Token Endpoint Client Authentication\r\n\r\nAt this point the supported __Client Authentication__ method is \"__Client Secret Basic__\" - usage of\r\n\"Client ID\" & \"Client Secret\".\r\n\r\n## Consent Authorization\r\n\r\nIn order for a PSU to Authorize a Consent, they need to be redirected to the appropriate Consent UI.\r\n<br /><br />  In order for this redirection to take place the TPP needs to follow the Authorization\r\nEndpoint by ammending the generated \"Consent ID\", like this:\r\nhttps://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?consent_id={{consent_id}}\r\n\r\nAfter a query to endpoint \r\n\r\n    POST/ funds-confirmations\r\n\r\nand the successful response, the respective consent will be revoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Feedback and Questions\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback and answer your questions. Send us at\r\n[developer@nbg.gr](developer@nbg.gr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out our [Sandbox Postman\r\nCollection](https://github.com/myNBGcode/PostmanCollections/tree/master/Confirmation%20of%20Funds%20-%20UK%20Open%20Banking)\r\n ________________________________________\r\n\r\nCreated by [**NBG**](https://www.nbg.gr/).\r\n"
