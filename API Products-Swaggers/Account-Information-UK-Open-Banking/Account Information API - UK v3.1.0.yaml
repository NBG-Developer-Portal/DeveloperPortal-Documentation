  description: "## Functionality at a glance\r\n\r\n\r\nStart integrating your application with NBG Bank:\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess the list of user accounts and its information (e.g. beneficiaries,  transactions):\r\n\r\n\r\n* Create the Consent with the appropriate permissions in order to be able to access the API Endpoints\r\n\r\n* Retrieve the list of accounts\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's details\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's balances\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's transactions\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's beneficiaries\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's standing orders\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's party\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's scheduled payments\r\n\r\n* Retrieve an account's statements\r\n\r\n\r\nNBG \"Account Information\" API that implements the [UK Open Banking Specification\r\nv3.1.](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/overview?mode=global) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. Login/Register to the NBG Technology HUB\r\n\r\n2. Go to APPS and click \"Create New App\"\r\n\r\n3. Go to API PRODUCTS and select an API\r\n\r\n4. Click \"Subscribe\" and choose your app\r\n\r\n5. Get an Access Token using the credentials you signed in as a developer\r\n\r\n6. Create a Sandbox\r\n\r\n7. Play with the API \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)\r\n\r\nThis API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a\r\nBearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be retrieved using the client_id and\r\nclient_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API, and your own credentials\r\n(username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB. The scopes are defined below:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sandbox Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t  sandbox-uk-account-info-api-v1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Production Scopes:** \r\n\r\n\t  accounts\r\n\r\n\r\n**Authorization Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t  https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize\r\n\r\n\r\n**Token Endpoint:** \r\n\r\n\t  https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token\r\n\r\n\r\nSee more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)\r\n\r\n\r\n## SMS Challenge (One Time Password)\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully authorize an Accounts Access you will need to provide the SMS OTP (One Time Password) in the corresponding Accounts Consent UI Screen.\r\n\r\nBy default the SMS OTP will be sent to the mobile number declared upon singing up in the NBG Technology HUB. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Create your Sandbox\r\n\r\nCreate a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox\r\nwith a unique sandbox-id.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Important!__ Before proceeding save the sandbox id you just created.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Start Testing\r\n\r\nOnce you have your sandbox-id, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the\r\nmandatory http header **sandbox-id**  and the http headers described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important notes\r\n\r\n\r\n**Request headers**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Authorization. The Auth2 Token\r\n\r\n2. x-fapi-financial-id. The unique id of the ASPSP to which the request is issued (Default: NBG)\r\n\r\n3. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID\r\n\r\n\r\n**Consent**\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to effectively start using the Endpoints the appropriate Consent needs to be\r\ncreated and set to the 'Authorised' status. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to create the Consent you need to at least set the required **permissions** and the **Risk**\r\nsections. \r\n\r\n\r\nOptionally you may set the \r\n\r\n\r\n1. ExpirationDateTime. When the Consent expires \r\n\r\n\r\n2. TransactionFromDateTime. Start Date to retrieve the transactions \r\n\r\n\r\n3. TransactionToDateTime. End Date to retrieve the transactions \r\n\r\n\r\n## Error Codes\r\n\r\nThe error codes and their description can be found\r\n[here](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/937656404/Read+Write+Data+API+Specification+-+v3.1#Read/WriteDataAPISpecification-v3.1-ErrorResponseStructure)\r\n\r\n\r\n# UK OPB Implementation Specifics \r\n\r\nBelow you may find more specific information & limitations regarding the implementation followed in the Production API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Token Endpoint Client Authentication\r\n\r\nAt this point the supported __Client Authentication__ method is \"__Client Secret Basic__\" - usage of \"Client ID\" & \"Client Secret\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Consent Authorization\r\n\r\nIn order for a PSU to Authorize a Consent, they need to be redirected to the appropriate Consent UI. <br /><br />  In order for this redirection to take place the TPP needs to follow the Authorization Endpoint by ammending the generated \"Consent ID\", like this: https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize?consent_id={{consent_id}}\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOnce the PSU is redirected to the Consent Authorization Screen, they need to enter their IBank Credentials and either Authorize or Reject the Consent. \r\n<br/><br/> \r\nAt this point the Consent is binded with the PSU.\r\n\r\n## Feedback and Questions\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback and answer your questions. Send us at\r\n[developer@nbg.gr](developer@nbg.gr)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out our [Sandbox Postman\r\nCollection](https://github.com/myNBGcode/PostmanCollections/tree/master/Account%20Information%20-%20UK%20Open%20Banking/)!\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nCreated by [**NBG**](https://www.nbg.gr/).\r\n"
