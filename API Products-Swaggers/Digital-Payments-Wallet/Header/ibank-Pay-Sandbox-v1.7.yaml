    ## What can I do?

    Perform money transfers to another member or merchant or even make donations
    by just **registering as a Member** to our service and verifying your mobile
    device as a trusted one. Once the registration step is completed simply
    **select the other member** you wish to **send money to or request money from
    or pay** and pretty much that's it.

    ## Quick Getting Started
    
    
    1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB
    
    2. Go to **"APPS"**
    
    3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\"** and follow the steps below:
        1. Enter the title of your Organization
        2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)
        3. Click **"SUBMIT"**
        
    4. Select the Organization of choice and click **"ADD AN APPLICATION"** 
          1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)
          2. Check **\"Authorization Code\" and \"Client Credentials\"** 
          3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)
              
              You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*
          4. Click **"SUBMIT"**
          5. Store the APPs **"Client ID"** and **"Client Secret"**
    5. Go to **"API PRODUCTS"** and select the **DIGITAL PAYMENTS WALLET API**
    
    6. Click **\"START USING THIS API\"**, choose your app and click
    **"SUBSCRIBE"**
    
    7. Create a Sandbox
    
    8. Play with the API
    

    ## Create your Sandbox

    Sandboxes are self - contained testing environments that provide a simple way of testing the API without any real impact, meaning that no personal or financial data is used.


    1. **Create your first Sandbox Application**

    Create a new Sandbox application by invoking the _POST_ /_**sandbox**_. This
    call will generate a new Sandbox with a unique sandbox_id , application_id
    and a user_id. IDs are UUIDs ([GUID generator](https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx)).
    
       **_Important!_** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all the API calls.


    2. **Create your Sandbox Users**

    After creating your sandbox application, administrators may create users using POST /sandbox/**{sandbox_id}**_/_**users **



    ## How do I log in?

    You can call the i-bank Pay API by logging in and getting a cookie with the following cases: 

    1.  Log in as a user with userId and password

    2.  Log in as a user with prepaid card number

    3.  Log in as a user with product barcode

    4.  Log in as a user with fast login (pin or fingerprint id)

    5.  Log in as a middleware with userId and password

    6.  Log in as a pos terminal with userId and password



    Login is completed with two steps:



    **Step 1 (Send Credentials)**



    User invokes one POST method to the login category (e.g https://apis.nbg.gr/sandbox/ibankpay/headers/v1.7/Login/userLogin/xxx})
    with Content-Type: application/json and a JSON request with the credentials. xxx is an application identifier for the login
    generated by the bank. User gets a Json response with realm and parameters to use for the next step.



    **Step 2 (Cookie receipt)**



    User invokes one POST method to the realm of the response of the previous call with Content-Type:
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded the parameters of that call. For the purposes of this Sandbox this step
    is simulated by the p2pproxy action



    **API Calls**



    In order to call the API the retrieved cookie should be added to the request header and the endpoint should be
    formed with the realm plus the api/{controller/{action}. 



    ## How do I register as a member?

    Simply invoke the /p2p/_**registerMember**_ and you are done.



    ## How do I send money?

    Once you have registered as a member find from your list of contacts the member you wish to send money or make
    a donation (e.g. Unicef).



    ## How do I request money?

    Simply invoke the /p2p/_**credit**_ and the other member can accept or reject it.



    ## How do I pay a merchant?

    The merchant will invoke the /p2p/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistration**_ and then the member can accept the payment by invoking the /p2p/_**acceptCredit**_ or reject it by invoking the /p2p/_**rejectCredit**_ .



    ## Sandbox Member Endpoints 

    1.  _POST_ /p2p/_**registerMember**_

    If you are not already registered to our service, invoke this endpoint to register. The mobile device registration
    is mandatory.


    2.  _POST_ /p2p/_**productList**_

    Invoke this endpoint to find the list of your accounts and cards.

    3.  _POST_ /p2p/_**selectAccount**_

    Invoke this endpoint to select the account you wish to use (e.g. an account or card). This is useful for the users
    that have registered as members with more than one account.

    4.  _POST_ /p2p/_**discoverMemberV2**_

    Invoke this endpoint to search for members by supplying their network id (e.g. mobile phone number)

    5.  _POST_ /p2p/_**payV2**_

    Invoke this endpoint to make a payment to another member.

    6.  _POST_ /p2p/_**credit**_

    Invoke this endpoint to make a request to another member to send you money.

    7.  _POST_ /p2p/_**acceptCredit**_

    Invoke this endpoint to accept another's member request to send him money (or approve a merchant payment)

    8.  _POST_ /p2p/_**rejectCredit**_

    Invoke this endpoint to reject another's member request to send him money

    9.  _POST_ /p2p/_**walletTransactionList**_

    Invoke this endpoint to get the list of your transactions

    10. _POST_ /p2p/_**disableMember**_

    Invoke this endpoint to deactivate yourself as member



    ## Sandbox Merchant Endpoints:

    1. _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistration**_

    Invoke this endpoint to create a payment request as a merchant


    2.  _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistrationV2**_

    Invoke this endpoint to create a payment request as a merchant

    3. _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestInfo**_

    Invoke this endpoint to get the status of the payment request



    ## Use cases

    **Use Case 1**: A user owns a prepaid card or a payband (wearable) and wants to view the card balance and the list of card transactions through his mobile device. The API call sequence should be:

      1. _POST_ **/Login/AskProductCode** and a verification code will be sent via SMS to the card owner

        2. _POST_ **/Login/Productlogin** to login using the card number or barcode and the verification code

        3. _POST_ **/Login/p2pproxy** to get the token needed to access the API

        4. _POST_ **/p2p/askAccountV3** to check if wallet member already exists

        5. _POST_ **/p2p/registerAccount** to create a new wallet member, if additional verification is required a verification code will be sent via SMS to register the mobile device (bypass if member already exists)

        6. _POST_ **/p2p/registerDevice** to register the mobile device (bypass if member does not already exist)

        7. _POST_ **/p2p/verifyDeviceRegistration** to complete the mobile device registration using the verification code (if additional verification was required)

        8. _POST_ **/p2p/askAccountV3** to get the wallet member status

        9. _POST_ **/p2p/registerAccountFastLogin** to set a PIN or fingerprint for the fast login feature

        10. _POST_ **/Login/fastLogin** to login using the PIN or fingerprint

        11. _POST_ **/Login/p2pproxy** to get the token needed to access the API

        12. _POST_ **/p2p/getAccountsInfo** to retrieve the card balance

        13. _POST_ **/p2p/getProductTransactions** to retrieve the list of card transactions

        14. _POST_ **/p2p/addForeignAccount** to add an additional prepaid card or payband (wearable), a verification code will be sent via SMS to the card owner

        15. _POST_ **/p2p/addAccountVerification** to complete the additional card/payband addition using the verification code

        16. _POST_ **/p2p/getAccountsInfo** to retrieve the card balance for both cards

        17. _POST_ **/p2p/getProductTransactions** to retrieve the list of card transactions for the additional card

    Postman collections for Use Case 1 are available.

COMPLETED: The online transaction was completed and the payment has been scheduled for clearance.

FAILED: The online transaction failed to complete.

CANCELLED: The previously completed online transaction has been successfully cancelled and the payment will not be scheduled for clearance.

REVERTED: (Applies only to payments whose method is CARD) The transaction was initially registered in the bank's system, but due to a technical reversal request that occurred in the card transaction processing system, the payment was successfully reverted and a card transaction reversal was executed.

REVFAILED: (Applies only to payments whose method is CARD)  The transaction was initially registered in the bank's system, but due to a technical reversal request that occurred in the card transaction processing system, a card transaction reversal was executed but the payment was not successfully reverted.

SUSPECT: (Applies only to online TopUp transactions) The transaction was flagged as suspect, since the payment's clearance was performed in the bank's system, but an error occurred during the communication with the Provider, in order to acknowledge the successful billing. Therefore, the TopUp status is in need of further investigation.

PARTIAL_PROCESS: (Applies only to only WIND TopUp transactions) The online transaction was completed and the payment's clearance was performed in the bank's system, but the Provider rejected the related transaction, so the TopUP failed.        

DEFERRED: The transaction has been registered in the system successfully and will be executed at the specified date."
