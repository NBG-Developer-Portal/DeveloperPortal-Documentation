  title: i-bank Pay OAuth2 Sandbox API
  description: "## What can I do?\nPerform money transfers to another member or merchant or even make donations by just **registering as a Member** to our service and verifying your mobile device as a trusted one. Once the registration step is completed simply **select the other member** you wish to **send money to or request money from or pay** and pretty much that's it.\n\n\n\n## How To Get Started \n\n1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB\n2. Go to **\"APPS\"** and  click **\"Create New App\"**:\n    1. Fill in the form fields.\n    2. Check **\"Authorization Code\"** and **\"Client Credentials\"**\n    3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)\n       \n       You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal:\n *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*\n    4. **Submit** your new APP\n    5. Store the APPs **\"Client ID\"** and **\"Client Secret\"**\n3. Go to **\"API PRODUCTS\"** and select the **[Digital Payments Wallet](https://developer.nbg.gr/partner/apiProduct/)**\n4. Click **\"START USING THIS API\"**, choose your app and click **\"SUBSCRIBE\"**\n5. Get an Access Token using the **[Authorization Code](https://developer.nbg.gr/documentation/Get-Token-API-v1-4379#tag/Authorization-Code)** Flow (with the credentials that you used to sign in as a developer) and the **API scopes** provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below\n\n      **Please note:** The access token is required for using the API and is valid for a specific period of time (3600 seconds).\n6. Create a **[Sandbox](https://developer.nbg.gr/documentation//ibank-Pay-Sandbox-OAuth2-v16#operation/Sandbox_CreateSandbox)**\n\n\n7. **Play** with the API\n\n**Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)**\n\n This API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a Bearer (access token) should be acquired.\n\nAn access token can be retrieved using the client_id and client_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API and your own credentials (username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB.The scopes are defined below: \n\n**SCOPES**\n\nFor the ***Authorization*** Code:\n\n **Sandbox**:\n\n    sandbox-i-bank-pay-api-v1-7\n\n **Production**: \n\n    IBankPay-api-v1\n\n \n\nFor the ***Client Credentials***:\n\n **Sandbox**: \n\n    sandbox-i-bank-pay-api-v1-7\n\n **Production**: \n\n    IBankPay-api-v1\n\n**ENDPOINTS**\n\n**Authorization Endpoint**: https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize\n\n**Token Endpoint:** https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token\n\nSee more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)\n\n**Create your Sandbox**\n\nSandboxes are self - contained testing environments that provide a simple way of testing the API without any real impact, meaning that no personal or financial data is used.\n\n You can create your Sandbox by invoking the POST /api/sandbox call by simply providing an \"id\" as your sandbox id and naming it almost anything you like. A sandbox with pre-populated data will be created.\n\n**Important!** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all the API calls. Sandbox endpoints are not included in the production version API.\n\nThe following HTTP **header parameters** are required for every call (except for sandbox operations):\n1.\tsandbox_id \n2.\t Authorization\n\n**Sandbox Operations:** \n1.\tCreate a sandbox: POST /sandbox \n2.\tExport a sandbox: GET /sandbox/{sandbox_id}\n3.\tImport a sandbox: PUT /sandbox/{sandbox_id}\n4.\tDelete a sandbox: DELETE /sandbox/{sandbox_id}\n5.\tCreate your Sandbox Users: After creating your sandbox application, administrators may create users using POST /sandbox/{sandbox_id}/users\n6.\tCreate a sandbox POS device: POST /sandbox/devices\n\n## How do I log in?\nYou can call the i-bank Pay API by logging in and getting a cookie with the following cases: \n1.\tLog in as a user with userId and password\n2.\tLog in as a user with prepaid card number\n3.\tLog in as a user with product barcode\n4.\tLog in as a user with fast login (pin or fingerprint id)\n5.\tLog in as a middleware with userId and password\n6.\tLog in as a pos terminal with userId and password\n\nLogin is completed with two steps:\n\n**Step 1 (Send Credentials)**\n\nUser invokes one POST method to the login category (e.g https://apis.nbg.gr/sandbox/ibankpay/oauth2/v1.7/Login/userLogin/xxx}) with Content-Type: application/json and a JSON request with the credentials. xxx is an application identifier for the login generated by the bank.\n\nUser gets a Json response with realm and parameters to use for the next step\n\n**Step 2 (Cookie receipt)**\n\nUser invokes one POST method to the realm of the response of the previous call with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded the parameters of that call. For the purposes of this Sandbox this step is simulated by the p2pproxy action\n\n**API Calls**\n\nIn order to call the API the retrieved cookie should be added to the request header and the endpoint should be formed with the realm plus the api/{controller/{action}. \n\n## How do I register as a member?\nSimply invoke the /p2p/_**registerMember**_ and you are done.\n\n## How do I send money?\nOnce you have registered as a member find from your list of contacts the member you wish to send money or make a donation (e.g. Unicef).\n\n## How do I request money?\nSimply invoke the /p2p/_**credit**_ and the other member can accept or reject it.\n\n## How do I pay a merchant?\nThe merchant will invoke the /p2p/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistration**_ and then the member can accept the payment by invoking the /p2p/_**acceptCredit**_ or reject it by invoking the /p2p/_**rejectCredit**_ .\n\n## Sandbox Member Endpoints \n1.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**registerMember**_\nIf you are not already registered to our service, invoke this endpoint to register. The mobile device registration is mandatory.\n2.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**productList**_\nInvoke this endpoint to find the list of your accounts and cards.\n3.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**selectAccount**_\nInvoke this endpoint to select the account you wish to use (e.g. an account or card). This is useful for the users that have registered as members with more than one account.\n4.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**discoverMemberV2**_\nInvoke this endpoint to search for members by supplying their network id (e.g. mobile phone number)\n5.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**payV2**_\nInvoke this endpoint to make a payment to another member.\n6.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**credit**_\nInvoke this endpoint to make a request to another member to send you money.\n7.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**acceptCredit**_\nInvoke this endpoint to accept another's member request to send him money (or approve a merchant payment)\n8.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**rejectCredit**_\nInvoke this endpoint to reject another's member request to send him money\n9.\t_POST_ /p2p/_**walletTransactionList**_\nInvoke this endpoint to get the list of your transactions\n10. _POST_ /p2p/_**disableMember**_\nInvoke this endpoint to deactivate yourself as member\n\n\n## Sandbox Merchant Endpoints:\n1. _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistration**_\nInvoke this endpoint to create a payment request as a merchant\n2. _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistrationV2**_\nInvoke this endpoint to create a payment request as a merchant\n3. _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestInfo**_\nInvoke this endpoint to get the status of the payment request\n\n## Use cases\n**Use Case 1**. A user owns a prepaid card or a payband (wearable) and wants to view the card balance and the list of card transactions through his mobile device. The API call sequence should be:\n1. _POST_ **/p2p/askAccountV3** to check if wallet member already exists\n2. _POST_ **/p2p/registerAccount** to create a new wallet member, if additional verification is required a verification code will be sent via SMS to register the mobile device (bypass if member already exists)\n3. _POST_ **/p2p/registerDevice** to register the mobile device (bypass if member does not already exist)\n4. _POST_ **/p2p/verifyDeviceRegistration** to complete the mobile device registration using the verification code (if additional verification was required)\n5. _POST_ **/p2p/askAccountV3** to get the wallet member status\n6. _POST_ **/p2p/registerAccountFastLogin** to set a PIN or fingerprint for the fast login feature\n7. Log in again so the token is updated.\n8. _POST_ **/p2p/getAccountsInfo** to retrieve the card balance\n9. _POST_ **/p2p/getProductTransactions** to retrieve the list of card transactions\n10. _POST_ **/p2p/addForeignAccount** to add an additional prepaid card or payband (wearable), a verification code will be sent via SMS to the card owner\n11. _POST_ **/p2p/addAccountVerification** to complete the additional card/payband addition using the verification code\n12. _POST_ **/p2p/getAccountsInfo** to retrieve the card balance for both cards\n13. _POST_ **/p2p/getProductTransactions** to retrieve the list of card transactions for the additional card\n\n\n**Use Case 2**: A user gives consent for an account, registers to wallet, loads an amount to it and makes a payment. The API call sequence should be:\n1. _POST_ **/p2p/askMemberV2** to check if wallet member already exists\n2. _POST_ **/p2p/registerMember** to create a new wallet member, a verification code will be sent via SMS to register the mobile device\n3. _POST_ **/p2p/verifyDeviceRegistration** to complete the mobile device registration using the verification code\n4. Log in again so the token is updated.\n5. _POST_ **/p2p/askMemberV2** to get the wallet member status\n6. _POST_ **/balance/load** to load an amount to the wallet\n7. _POST_ **/balance/info** to get the wallet balance info\n8. _POST_ **/p2b/machinePaymentRequestRegistrationV2** to create a payment request as a merchant. **This call is invoked by the POS**\n9. _POST_ **/p2b/paymentRequestInfoV3** to get the payment info(should be pending)\n10. _POST_ **/p2p/acceptCreditV2** to accept the payment\n11. _POST_ **/p2b/machinePaymentRequestInfo** to complete the payment as a merchant. **This call is invoked by the POS**\n12. _POST_ **/p2b/paymentRequestInfoV3** to get the payment info(should be completed)\n\n**Use Case 3**: A registered user sends money to a friend that is registered to a different bank via SEPA Credit Tranfer insant (SCT Inst). The API call sequence should be:\n1. _POST_  **/p2p/askMemberv2**  to get the wallet member status\n2. _POST_  **/p2p/payv4**  to get the payment's commission and the contact's info\n3. _POST_  **/p2p/payv4**  to execute the payment\n4. _POST_  **/p2p/remittanceQuery**  to ask for the payment's status (should be completed within 10 seconds). Recurring calls are required.\n\nPostman collections for Use Cases are available [here](https://github.com/NBG-Developer-Portal/i-bank-Pay-API/tree/master/v1.7/oauth2)"
