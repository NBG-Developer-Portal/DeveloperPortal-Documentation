  version: v1.7
  description: >
    ## What can I do?

    Perform money transfers to another member or merchant or even make donations by just **registering as a Member** to our service and verifying your mobile device as a trusted one. Once the registration step is completed simply
    **select the other member** you wish to **send money to or request money from or pay** and pretty much that's it.


    ## Quick Getting Started


    1. **Login/Register** to the NBG Technology HUB

    2. Go to **"APPS"**
    
    3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click **\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\"** and follow the steps below:
        1. Enter the title of your Organization
        2. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)
        3. Click **"SUBMIT"**

    4. Select the Organization of choice and click **"ADD AN APPLICATION"** 
          1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)
          2. Check **\"Authorization Code\" and \"Client Credentials\"** 
          3. Enter the **OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs** (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)
              
              You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: *https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*
          4. Click **"SUBMIT"**
          5. Store the APPs **"Client ID"** and **"Client Secret"**
    5. Go to **"API PRODUCTS"** and select the **Digital Payments Wallet API**
    
    6. Click **\"START USING THIS API\"**, choose your app and click
    **"SUBSCRIBE"**

    7. Get an Access Token using the Access Token Flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below

    8. Create a Sandbox

    9. Play with the API


    ## Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)

     This API version uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a Bearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be retrieved using the client_id and client_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API, and your own credentials (username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB. The scopes are defined below:


    **Sandbox Scopes**:
    
          sandbox-i-bank-pay-api-v1-7


    **Production Scopes**:
    
          i-bank-pay-api-v1-7


    **Authorization Endpoint**:
    
          https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize


    **Token Endpoint**:
    
          https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token


    See more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)



    ## Create your Sandbox

    Sandboxes are self - contained testing environments that provide a simple way of testing the API without any real impact, meaning that no personal or financial data is used.


     You can create your **your Sandbox**  by invoking the POST /api/sandbox call
     by simply providing an \"id\" as your sandbox id and naming it almost anything you like. A sandbox with pre-populated data will be created.

    **_Important!_** Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all
    the API calls. Sandbox endpoints are not included in the production version
    API.


    The following HTTP **header parameters** are required for every call (except
    for sandbox operations): 

    1.  sandbox_id 

    2.  Authorization



    **Sandbox Operations**:

    1.  Create a sandbox: POST /sandbox 

    2.  Export a sandbox: GET /sandbox/{sandbox_id}

    3.  Import a sandbox: PUT /sandbox/{sandbox_id}

    4.  Delete a sandbox: DELETE /sandbox/{sandbox_id}

    5.  Create your Sandbox Users: After creating your sandbox application, administrators may create users using POST /sandbox/{sandbox_id}/users

    6.  Create a sandbox POS device: POST /sandbox/devices
    
    
    ## Start Testing

    Once you have your sandbox_id, you can start invoking the rest of the
    operations by providing all the mandatory information in the http header.
    
    
     ## Important notes

    Request headers

    Each request MUST have the following info:


    *sandbox_id*, *Authorization*


    ## How do I register as a member?

    Simply invoke the /p2p/_**registerMember**_ and you are done.



    ## How do I send money?

    Once you have registered as a member find from your list of contacts the member you wish to send money or make a donation (e.g. Unicef).



    ## How do I request money?

    Simply invoke the /p2p/_**credit**_ and the other member can accept or reject it.



    ## How do I pay a merchant?

    The merchant will invoke the /p2p/_**machinePaymentRequestRegistration**_ and then the member can accept the payment by invoking the /p2p/_**acceptCredit**_ or reject it by invoking the /p2p/_**rejectCredit**_ .



    ## Sandbox Member Endpoints 

    1.  _POST_ /p2p/_**registerMember**_

    3. _POST_ /p2b/_**machinePaymentRequestInfo**_

    ## Use cases

    **Use Case 1**: A user owns a prepaid card or a payband (wearable) and wants to view the card balance and the list of card transactions through his mobile device. The API call sequence should be:



    1. _POST_ **/p2p/askAccountV3** to check if wallet member already exists



    2. _POST_ **/p2p/registerAccount** to create a new wallet member, if additional verification is required a verification code will be sent via SMS to register the mobile device (bypass if member already exists)



    3. _POST_ **/p2p/registerDevice** to register the mobile device (bypass if member does not already exist)



    4. _POST_ **/p2p/verifyDeviceRegistration** to complete the mobile device registration using the verification code (if additional verification was required)



    5. _POST_ **/p2p/askAccountV3** to get the wallet member status



    6. _POST_ **/p2p/registerAccountFastLogin** to set a PIN or fingerprint for the fast login feature



    7. Log in again so the token is updated.



    8. _POST_ **/p2p/getAccountsInfo** to retrieve the card balance



    9. _POST_ **/p2p/getProductTransactions** to retrieve the list of card transactions



    10. _POST_ **/p2p/addForeignAccount** to add an additional prepaid card or payband (wearable), a verification code will be sent via SMS to the card owner



    11. _POST_ **/p2p/addAccountVerification** to complete the additional card/payband addition using the verification code



    12. _POST_ **/p2p/getAccountsInfo** to retrieve the card balance for both cards



    13. _POST_ **/p2p/getProductTransactions** to retrieve the list of card transactions for the additional card



    Postman collections for Use Case 1 are available.
