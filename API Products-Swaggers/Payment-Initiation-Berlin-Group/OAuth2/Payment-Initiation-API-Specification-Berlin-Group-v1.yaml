  title: Payment Initiation API Specification - Berlin Group
  description: "## Functionality at a glance\r\n\r\nThe NBG \"Berlin Group Payments Initiation\" API follows the \"Berlin Group Specification v1.3.6\".\r\n\r\nThis Payment Initiation API Specification describes the flows and payloads for initiating and executing a general payment-order.\r\n\r\nThe API endpoints described here allow a PISP to:\r\n\r\n- Register an intent to stage a payment-order (initiate a payment).\r\n\r\n- Submit the payment-order for processing.\r\n\r\n- Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order resource.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n## Quick Getting Started\r\n1. <b>Login/Register</b> to the NBG Technology HUB\r\n\r\n2. Go to <b>\"APPS\"</b>\r\n\r\n3. Select your Organization and go to step 4. If you want to create a new Organization click <b>\"CREATE AN ORGANIZATION\"</b> and follow the steps below:\r\n\r\n    1. Enter the title of your Organization\r\n    1. Enter a short description of your Organization (optional)\r\n    2. Click \"SUBMIT\"\r\n\r\n4. Select the Organization of choice and click <b>\"ADD AN APPLICATION\"</b>\r\n\r\n    1. Fill in the forms (title and short description)\r\n    \r\n    2. Check <b>\"Authorization Code\"</b> and <b>\"Client Credentials\"</b>\r\n    \r\n    3. Enter the <b>OAuth Redirect and Post Logout URIs</b> (these are the URIs that we will redirect the user upon logging in and logging out respectively)\r\n    \r\n    4. *You can use the following redirect URL to easily test the API through the portal: https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth2/redoc-callback*\r\n    \r\n    6. Click <b>\"SUBMIT\"</b>\r\n    \r\n    7. Store the APPs <b>\"Client ID\"</b> and <b>\"Client Secret\"</b>\r\n\r\n5. Go to <b>\"API PRODUCTS\"</b> and select the <b>PAYMENT INITIATION - BG OPEN BANKING API</b>\r\n\r\n6. Click <b>\"START USING THIS API\"</b>, choose your app and click <b>\"SUBSCRIBE\"</b>\r\n\r\n7. Get an <b>Access Token</b> using the Access Token Flow and the API scopes provided in the Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2) section below\r\n\r\n8. Create a <b>Sandbox</b>\r\n\r\n9. Play with the API\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Sandbox Flow\r\nThe Sandbox Flow matches the Production Flow. The difference lies into the Data used. Instead of live data, the Sandbox flow uses mocked data.\r\n\r\n### Production Flow\r\nThe Production Flow is described in the Berlin Group Specification v1.3.6\r\n\r\nMore details about the implementation specifics followed, please visit section [Berlin Group Specification page](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)\r\nThe Berlin Group Payments API Specification uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization, which means that a Bearer (access token) should be acquired. An access token can be retrieved using the client_id and client_secret of the APP that you created and subscribed in this API, and finally your own credentials (username, password) that you use to sign in the NBG Technology HUB.\r\n\r\nThe scopes are defined below:\r\n\r\nAuthorization Endpoint:\r\n\r\n    https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/authorize\r\nToken Endpoint:\r\n\r\n    https://my.nbg.gr/identity/connect/token\r\n\r\n**Authorization Code**\r\n\r\nSandbox Scopes:\r\n\r\n     sandbox-bg-ob-payments offline_access\r\nProduction Scopes:\r\n\r\n    bg-ob-payments offline_access\r\n\r\nSee more [here](https://developer.nbg.gr/oauth-document)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### QWAC Certificates\r\nTPPs are required to present a QWAC certificate during API consumption. \r\nThe API checks that this certificate has been provided and is valid. \r\nIn sandbox mode the certificate validations are optional. \r\nTo validate your certificate in sandbox implementation, please send us your QWAC \r\ncertificate at developer@nbg.gr and set the HTTP Header **\"x-sandbox-qwac-certificate-check\"** with the value **\"true\"** in your requests.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### SMS Challenge (One Time Password)\r\nIn order to successfully complete a Payment you will need to provide the SMS OTP (One Time Password) in the corresponding Payments Consent UI Screen.\r\n\r\nBy default the SMS OTP will be sent to the mobile number declared upon singing up in the NBG Technology HUB.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Create your Sandbox\r\nCreate a new Sandbox application by invoking the POST /sandbox. This call will generate a new Sandbox with a unique sandbox-id.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a sandbox, users and sandbox specific data are generated as sample data.\r\n\r\nImportant! Don't lose your sandbox_id, since you will need it for all the API calls. Sandbox endpoints are not included in the production version API.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Start Testing\r\nOnce you have your **sandbox-id**, you can start invoking the rest of the operations by providing the mandatory http header sandbox-id and the http headers described below.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Important notes\r\n**Request headers**\r\n\r\nThe following HTTP header parameters are required for every call:\r\n\r\n1. Authorization. The OAuth2 Token\r\n\r\n2. sandbox-id. Your Sandbox ID\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n## Berlin Group Specification Specifics Implementation\r\nIn the below section we describe the flow we follow regarding a Payment Initiation and execution among with any other specific information is needed in order for you to successfully use the Berlin Group Specification Payments API.\r\n\r\n### General Flow\r\n1. TPP requests to initiate a Payment by utilizing the supported **Payment Iniitation Endpoint** and by using an **Authorization Flow OAuth2 Access Token**.\r\n    \r\n    This implies that the User needs to be identified by NBG prior to the Payments Initiation Request. The obtained Authorization Access Token will be used to access the resource.\r\n \r\n2. A **Payment-ID** is returned as a response to the Payments Initiation Request, among with the appropriate **Payment Authorization UI URL**.\r\n\r\n    The Payment Authorization UI URL can be found in the \"Links\" section of the Payment Initiation Response.\r\n\r\n3. The **User** need to be **redirected** by the TPP to the **Payment Authorization UI** where they **authorize** the Payment Execution.\r\n    \r\n    **SCA** is needed for the User in order to authorize the Payment.\r\n\r\n    Once the User successfully authorizes the Payment, then it is automatically **executed**.\r\n\r\n4. Finally, the TPP has the option to **inquire** the **Payment's status** by using the **Payment-ID** and via the appropriate endpoints.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n#### User Identification and Obtaining Token\r\nThe process is described in the \"Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2)\" Section.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n#### Payment Authorization UI\r\nThe Payment Authorization UI will be available only for a **short amount of time** and reachable only by the **User requesting the Payment Execution**.\r\n\r\nThe Payment Authorization UI URL can be found in the \"Links\" section of the Payment Initiation Response.\r\n\r\nThe **Payments Authorization UI URL** can be found in the Payments Initiation Response, in the \"**_links / scaRedirect**\" property.\r\n\r\nIn case a redirection is needed the \"**callback_url**\" attribute needs to be appended to the **Authorization URL** (e.g. https://microsites.nbg.gr/bg.ob.pisp.sandbox/payments/authorize?payment_id=xxxxxxxx-f6ca-434b-xxxx-257450ac3903&callback_url=https://www.nbg.gr).\r\nAlternatively, the http header \"**TPP-Callback-Url**\" can be sent during the initiation request, and its value will be pre-attached to the \"**scaRedirect**\" property.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n#### Signing\r\nSigning is not used in this version. Securiy relys on QWAC certificates.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n#### SCA Processes\r\nCurrently, multiple SCA processes are not supported.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n#### Access Tokens and Endpoints\r\nAll endpoints can be called only by using an Authorization Flow Access Token.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### Supported Endpoints\r\nThe supported endpoints based on the selected flow are the following:\r\n\r\n1. [POST] Payment initiation request\r\n2. [GET] Get payment information\r\n3. [GET] Payment initiation status request\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### Supported Payment Services and Products\r\n\r\nThe supported Payment Products are the following ones for JSON and Pain001.001.003 Formats:\r\n\r\n1. SEPA Credit Transfers\r\n2. Cross Border Credit Transfers\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nThe support Payment Services are the following ones:\r\n\r\n1. Payments\r\n2. Bulk Payments (*only for Pain001.001.003 File Payments*)\r\n3. Periodic Payments (*Scheduled Payment / Standing Orders*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### Implementation Specifics\r\n\r\n#### Payment Initiation Request\r\n\r\n##### Debtor Account\r\nCurrently, payments using a Card are not supported.\r\n\r\nFor **SEPA** transfers the Debtor's **IBAN** or **MSISDN** is required.\r\n\r\nFor **CrossBorder** transfers the Debtor's **BBAN** can be used only if the **Creditor Agent** is provided.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Scheduled Payments\r\nTransfers with mobile phone number are supported (msisdn). \r\nThis feature is applicable only for SEPA payments (not periodical) with greek mobile number.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Scheduled Payments\r\nThe Payment Initiation Request has been extended to support **Scheduled Payments**.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the \"**requestedExecutionDateTime**\" DateTime field has been added to the \"**PaymentInitiationRequest**\" type.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Charge Bearers\r\nIn order to provide the User the option to select who will be bear the commissions the \"**PaymentInitiationRequest**\" type has been extended.\r\n\r\nThe \"chargeBearer\" option has been added. Possible values are:\r\n\r\n- Shared : Charges are shared between Debtor and Creditor\r\n- BorneByDebtor : Charges are beared by the Debtor \r\n- BorneByCreditor : Charges are beared by the Creditor\r\n\r\nIn case a charge option is not applicable for the transfer to be initiated, an error message will be returned.\r\n\r\nThe property is not applicable in Bulk / File Payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Charges\r\nCharge Type “**BorneByCreditor**” is allowed only to the following Currencies : \"USD\", \"CAD\", \"ZAR\", \"JPY\", \"AUD\", \"HKD\", \"TRY\"\r\n\r\nChage Type \"**BorneByDebtor**\" is allowed only for the \"EUR\" Currency\r\n\r\nCharge Type \"**BorneByDebtor**\" is not allowed for transfers to the following countries : \"GR\",\"AT\",\"BE\",\"BG\",\"CY\",\"CZ\",\"DE\",\"DK\",\"EE\",\"ES\",\"FI\",\"FR\",\"GB\",\"GF\",\"GI\",\"GP\",\"HU\",\"IE\",\"IS\",\"IT\",\"LI\",\"LT\",\"LU\",\"LV\",\"MC\",\"MQ\",\"MT\",\"NL\",\"NO\",\"RE\",\"RO\",\"PL\",\"PT\",\"SE\",\"SK\",\"SI\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Priority Code\r\nPriority Codes are supported by extending the \"**PaymentInitiationRequest**\" type.\r\n\r\nThe \"priorityCode\" property has been added which can be assigned one of the following values:\r\n\r\n1. Normal\r\n2. Urgent\r\n\r\nThe property is not applicable in Bulk / File Payments.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Periodic Payments\r\nThe \"Periodic Payments Initiation Request\" has been modified. More specifically, the \"**endDate**\" property has been removed and the \"**numberOfPayments**\" propery has been added.\r\n\r\nThe Standing Orders End Date will be caluclated by the \"Start Date\" and the provided \"Number of Payments\".\r\n\r\nPeriodic payments can not be initiated with MSISDN.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n#### Payment Initiation Response\r\nThe Payment Initiation Response has been updated in order to provide a more complete and full set of information.\r\n\r\nThe following information is returned:\r\n\r\n- **instructedAmount** : The net amount for the Credit Payment, Scheduled Payment, individual Payment in a Standing Order or the total net amount of all payments in a Bulk Payment Initiation.\r\n \r\n- **transactionFees** : The fees for a Credit Payment, Scheduled Payment, individual Payment in a Standing Order or the total fees of all payments in a Bulk Payment Initiation.\r\n\r\n- **estimatedTotalAmount** : The sum of the \"instructedAmount\" and \"transactionFees\"\r\n\r\n- **chargeBearer** : The bearer of the commissions. Applicable in Credit and Periodic Payments\r\n\r\n- **numberOfPayments** : The number of the payments to take place in a Periodic Payment Initiation\r\n\r\n- **transactionStatus** : The current status of the transaction/payment\r\n - Just after payment initiation request -> PDNG\r\n - PSU rejects the payment in the UI -> RJCT\r\n - 10 minutes pass without PSU authorizing or rejecting the payment -> CANC\r\n - In the case of payment authorization from the PSU, here are the scenarios:\r\n   - For scheduled/recurrent/batch payments with a future date -> PDNG\r\n   - For batch payments with a date less or equal to today -> ACSC\r\n   - In all other cases \r\n     - For NBG payments -> ACCC \r\n     - Rest -> ACSC\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n#### Error Codes\r\nSome returned Error Codes have been modified for simplicity.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the \"**401**\" and \"**403**\" Status Codes do not return the expected Return Data Type, but an empty response with the appropriate Status Code.\r\n\r\nFor \"**400**\" Status Code the following codes are currently supported\r\n - PARAMETER_NOT_CONSISTENT (Generic error code. E.g. when input is required but is not sent or is of the wrong type)\r\n - MISSING_HEADER  (Http Header missing. Currently returned when no PSU-IP-Address header is present)\r\n - INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS (Insufficient funds for payment completion)\r\n - EXECUTION_DATE_INVALID (Invalid execution date for cases where requestedExecutionDate is provided)\r\n - INVALID_USER_ACCOUNT (Debtor account does not belong to user) \r\n - INVALID_CHARGE_BEARER (Invalid charge bearer type)\r\n - INVALID_TOTAL_AMOUNT (Invalid total amount. Currently regards bulk payments)\r\n - INVALID_TRANSACTIONS_NUMBER (Invalid transactions number. Currently regards bulk payments)\r\n - INVALID_PAYMENTS_NUMBER (Invalid total payment number. Regards periodical payments)\r\n - INVALID_CURRENCY (Invalid currency)\r\n - INVALID_FREQUENCY (Invalid payment frequency. Regards periodical payments)\r\n - INVALID_IBAN (Invalid ΙΒΑΝ. When creditor account is not in ΙΒΑΝ format)\r\n - NON_NBG_IBAN (Invalid NBG IBAN. When debtor account is not NBG IBAN format)\r\n - INVALID_PRIORITY (Invalid priority code for requested transfer)\r\n - INVALID_MSISDN (Invalid phone number)\r\n - INVALID_CREDITOR_ACCOUNT (Currently returned when a transfer via msisdn is requested for non SEPA or periodical)\r\n\r\n# Feedback and Questions\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback and answer your questions.

Customer profile check was also successful.\r\n- 'ACSC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -    Settlement on the debtor's account has been completed.      **Usage:** this can be used by the first agent to report to the debtor that the transaction has been completed.       **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information.    It can only be used after bilateral agreement.\r\n- 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -    All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.\r\n- 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -    Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.\r\n- 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -    Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.\r\n- 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' -    Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customer's account.\r\n- 'RCVD': 'Received' -    Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.\r\n- 'PDNG': 'Pending' -    Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending.

Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.\r\n- 'PATC': 'PartiallyAcceptedTechnical'   Correct The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed. Syntactical and semantical validations are successful.   Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.\r\n- 'PART': 'PartiallyAccepted' -   A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status.   Remark: This code may be used only in case of bulk payments. It is only used in a situation where all mandated authorisations have been applied, but some payments have been rejected."
